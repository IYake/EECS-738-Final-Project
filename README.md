### Overview
We developed a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based on AlexNet and used it to classify a dataset of images into 200 categories corresponding to the object shown in the image. After being trained on the ImageNet dataset, our model outputs confidence levels for each category with *number* percent accuracy.

### Goal
Our goal is to write a Convolutional Neural Network that, given an image, classifies it.

### Approach


### Results


### Accuracy
*TBD*

### Requisites
The code was written from scratch using Python 3.7(?) and the following modules:

- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- Pickle
